notes: |
  - Don't move back to vertical too early.
  - Will happen at top, but don't do prematurely.
  - _Do_ lift with your back.  Can't deadlift without it.
  1.  Stance: shins 1 inch from bar
  2.  Grip
  3.  Shins: just kissing the bar
  4.  Squeeze your chest up.
      - without dropping hips
  5.  Push the floor away.
