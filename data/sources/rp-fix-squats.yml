notes:
- reviewed people's squats via video
- many cues, but ended up mentioning three most of the time
- 1.  toes out 45Â°, knees track toes
- people tend to set toes straight forward
- 2.  descend slowly, consider pause at bottom
- focus on pushing knees out
- spread weight evenly across toes and heels
- 3.  chest up at bottom
- tend to either
- shift to toes
- roll back on heels, cave chest, round back
- "not trying to sit down"
