title: L-Sit Tutorial
notes:
- not just strength
- requires mobility
- hamstring flexibility
- strengthen hip flexors and quads
- arms and shoulders to lift
- primarily abs and hip flexors
- scapular depressors
- shoulder extensors
- rectus femoris working hard in very short position
- if you cramp, it's the rectus femoris
- 90Â° angle
- shoulders depressed
- arms straight
- hips in line with hands
- pointing toes not essential
- on floor harder than elevated
- wise to start on parallettes
- before training, should be able to hold tuck sit for 10 seconds
- should be able to sit with legs straight and chest upright (flexibility)
- more flexibility is good
- can easily touch your toes
- stretch hamstrings in warmup for training
- start training without shoes
- Tuck Sit Raises a great regression
- keep hips in line with hands
- build to hold each rep 2-3 seconds at top
- make harder by extending knees
- 2-3 sets of 10-12 reps
- L-Sit Raises
- common to be able to hold only with slightly bent
- do raises with legs straight
- hips in line with hands
- to start, just get to position
- build to holding 2-3 seconds at top
- goal of 3-4 sets of 8-10 reps
- normal to be able to hold only the first few reps
- try to hold more reps each workout
- can do one leg at a time
- Supported Single-Leg Raises
- hands on parallettes, feet on floor
- lift one leg at a time
- keep knee straight
- lift as high as possible
- 3-4 sets of 8 reps each side
- to make harder, pause briefly at top
- Tuck Sit Single-Leg Extension
- start in tuck sit
- extend one leg at a time
- pause briefly
- repeat on other side
- to make harder, straighten one leg as bend the other
- to make easier, put off foot on the ground, light as possible
- 3-4 sets of 5-10 reps on each leg
- Tuck Sit to L-Sit
- now do both legs at once
- 3 sets of 5-10 reps
- L-Sit Attempts
- maximal effort
- against complacency
- when can hold 5 seconds, add max holds
- build toward 30-second holds
- include a few in training at least twice a week
- start with hardest, regress as you fatigue
