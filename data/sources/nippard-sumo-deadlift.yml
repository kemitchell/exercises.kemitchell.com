title: The Most Effective Way to Deadlift for Muscle and Strength
url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsrD5y8EIKU
exercises:
- sumo deadlift
notes: |
  - very similar to conventional deadlift
  - sumo harder on quads
  - conventional harder on spinal erectors
  - hands inside legs
  - choose based on comfort and strength
  - might be smart to alternate now and then
  - muscles
    - hip extension dominant
      - glutes
      - hamstrings
    - knee extension minor
      - quads
    - isometric spinal extension
      - spinal erectors
    - other isometric stabilization around shoulders
    - dominantly leg exercise
    - leg day staple

  ## Programming
  - multiple joints, large muscle masses
  - high weight, low reps
  - no more than 5-10 for hypertrophy
  - 1-5 for strength
  - more physically and mentally demanding than squat
  - no more than once or twice per week, even for advanced trainees

  ## Technique

  ### Equipment
  - flat-soled shoes
  - high socks versus scraping shins
  - optional 10 mm lever belt

  ### Foot Position
  - shins half inch behind bar
  - center bar over tongues of shoes
  - heels as far apart as possible while keeping heels in line with knees in start position
  - may transition out gradually from conventional
  - stretch inner thighs for mobility
  - the wider the feet, the more the toes flare out
  - push hips back to grab the bar
  - knees slightly out toward toes to the bottom

  ### Arm Position
  - arms straight down
  - some like slightly wider to avoid hitting quads

  ### Grip
  - alternate/over-under
    - much more weight
    - switch under and over hands
    - may increase injury if you twist at the top
  - double overhand
    - probably safest
    - will be limited by grip strength
  - hook grip
    - thumb between bar and fingers
    - painful adjustment period
  - straps
    - do at least one heavy set per workout without
    - otherwise grip strength lags
  - dig bar into base of hand
  - drive pinky into the bar to prevent fatigue

  ## Motion

  ### Concentric
  - pack lats, pull bar in close
  - don't want bar drifting out in front during lift
  - pull lower back into neutral position
  - creates hamstring stretch
  - a little upper back rounding okay
  - deep breath into gut
  - straight vertical line through scapula, bar, foot
  - pull slack out
  - crucial step
  - don't "grip and rip"
  - explosive lift
  - lead with chest
  - drive hips forward
  - cue driving feet into floor
  - but don't shoot hips up
  - driving hips forward, not up
  - three isometric
    - lumbar spine
    - shoulder blades
    - shoulder pulling in to legs
  - bar moves up vertically and straight
  - drag up against shins
  - lock out
    - knees: straighten legs
    - hips: squeeze glutes
    - shoulders: chest up
  - no need to hyperextend or shrug

  ### Eccentric
  - some coaches: just let it fall
  - active resistance makes harder to recover
  - if you're new or re-learning, control it
  - about 1 second
  - set hips back first until about to clear knees
  - then let knees bend
  - finish in straight vertical line
  - full reset on the ground after each lift
  - don't bounce plates
  - begin again with deep breath
