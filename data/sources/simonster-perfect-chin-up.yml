title: Perfect Chin-Ups
notes:
- supinated grip / falms facing you
- pull-up to chin-up is a continuum
- shoulder extensors and elbow flexors
- back and front of arms
- same as in pull-ups
- supinating limits grip width and elbow flare
- too much flare stresses wrists
- more shoulder flexion and extension more than adduction and abduction
- arms in front, not out to sides
- shoulder width apart or slightly closer
- pull chin over bar
- fully straighten arms
- aim to pull chest to bar
- as long as chin clears bar
- at bottom, straighten eblows
- scapular depression important
- don't have to deliberately engage or depress separately
- can be integrated, happens naturally when trying to pull high
- rarely thinks about shoulder blades
- just hit the standards
- active or passive hang fine
- torso can be hollow or arched
- neither better or worse
- hollow body engages abs, make start harder
- arching makes harder to hold at top
- can combine, arch initially, hollow as chin clears
- don't swing or kip
- naturally easier at start, harder at top
- can target top or bottom
- make easier with band or feet to assist for harder, add weight, bias one side, or do in l-sit
