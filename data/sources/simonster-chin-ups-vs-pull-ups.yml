title: "Chin-Ups vs Pull-Ups: Which is Better for Strength & Muscle Growth?"
notes:
- hold a bowl of soup with supination
- pour something out with pronation
- grip on a continuum
- improving chin-up helps pull-up and vice-versa
- slightly different patterns and targeted areas
- chin-ups with hands closer to avoid wrist stress
- pull-ups opposite, since narrow uncomfortable at top
- chin-ups tend to use more shoulder extension
- pull-ups tend to use more shoulder adduction
- challenge lats at different lengths
- chin-ups give more stretch
- same primary muscle groups
- shoulder extensors/adductors
- latissimus dorsi
- teres major
- posterior deltoid
- elbow flexors
- biceps
- brachialis
- branchioradialis
- scapular retractors/depressors
- middle and lower trapezius
- rhomboids
- surface EMG findings not good proxy for muscle group
- chin-ups tend to be easier and stronger, can lift more weight, easier to hold top position
- most beginners unlock chin-up first
- chin-ups more stressful on common flexor tendon of elbow
- one-arm chin-up training commonly causes golfer's elbow
- transferability
- pull-ups to bar muscle-up
- chin-ups to rings muscle-up
- chin-ups may help more with front lever
- very similar, complementary
- include multiple grips for diverse gain and less injury
