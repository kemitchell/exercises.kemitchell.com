title: Do You Have a Perfect Squat?
url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPmvh7gBTi0
exercises:
- barbell squat
notes: |
  1.  bar placement
      - high bar:
          - on upper traps
          - more quads
      - low bar:
          - down 2-3 inches
          - more glutes and low back
  2.  efficient walkout
      - not too many steps
      - one to clear rack, one to match other foot, one adjustment step
  3.  stance width
      - narrow and wide both work
      - just outside shoulder width with slightly flared toes for most
  4.  depth
      - try to break parallel
      - a little short won't kill gains
      - powerlifting: hip crease beneath knee joint
  5.  bar path
      - ideally straight up and down
      - centered over middle of foot
      - keep in balance
