title: The Biggest Pull-Up Problem
source: Calisthenic Movement
exercises:
- pull-up
- arched pull-up
- ring row
- ring fly
notes:
- rounding of back at top
- address other back muscles
- include other back exercises, recommending body row as best all-rounder
- arched-back pull-up for more advanced, mix of pull-up and row, targets nearly whole posterior chain
- interference of anterior and posterior chains
- rhomboids, rear deltoids, trapezius, erector spinae
- hollow-body pull-up best body position to train for typewriter pull-ups, archer pull-ups, one-arm pull-ups, rope climbs
- hollow-body pull-up best for weighted pull-ups, due to straight spine back position
- intermediate or advanced, do both pull-up versions, plus other pulling exercises
- beginners focus on regular pull-ups, add other exercises like rows
