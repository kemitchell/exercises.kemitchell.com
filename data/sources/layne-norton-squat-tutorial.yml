exercises:
- barbell squat
notes: |
  - equipment
  - likes knee sleeves more than wraps for consistency and convenience
  - chalks his back
  - wraps above and below wrists, not just below them
  - belt doesn't lessen ab activation
  - high bar versus low bar
  - low bar better for most people, since closer to hip pivot point, creating less torque on lower back
  - to find toe angle, squeeze glutes, feet will rotate naturally
  - most people don't take in enough air
  - as much air as you can get
  - can generate most force when holding breath
  - push out abdominal wall, not flexing abs
  - like bracing for a punch
  - start squat driving hips back, sitting between legs
  - push up and also drive hips forward
  - drive knees out slightly over toes
  - don't lead with knees, will cause folding forward to achieve depth
  - less torque on knees with upright shins
  - lock glutes out at top
  - back angles very individual
  - maintain spine neutrality
  - don't go into spinal flexion, dangerous
  - most important in form is good depth
  - squat as deep as you safely can
  - with longer limbs, may not be able to go all the way down without losing neutrality
  - stop before losing neutrality
  - bar above midfoot
  - may not be completely straight
  - with long legs, have to lean forward, but minimize it
  - don't skip warmup sets, they're practice
  - > treat light weight like it's heavy
