title: Perfect Dips
notes: |
  Trains pecs, biceps, anterior delts.

  Primarily shoulder flexion and elbow extension.

  Some shoulder adduction.

  Hands roughly shoulder-width apart, arms straight.

  Push tall through soulder blades.

  Lean slightly on descent.  Reduces stress on shoulders.

  Until shoulders level with or lower than elbows.

  Can let hips bend.  But reduces planche-like difficulty.

  Below the elbows can yield more growth, but stretch still fine at level.  More stressful to shoulders.

  "Only lower as far as you feel comfortable."

  Keep depth consistent.

  Occasionally does deeper with less weight for variety.

  Can cross legs for full range of motion safely.  Doesn't cause symmetry problems.

  Can vary hand width.  Wider involves more shoulder adduction.

  Try to keep forearms approximately vertical.

  Planche- and 90-degree pushups require keeping the elbows in.

  Should retraction and protraction at the bottom both fine.

  He doesn't even think about shoulder position.

  Needn't obsess over head position.  No load or force transfer through neck from movement.

  To make easier, add band under knees.

  Can load with weight belt or bands, paused reps, straight body.
