title: Hanging Leg Raise (Toes to Bar) Tutorial
notes: |
  - abs and hip flexors
  - bent knee
  - straight leg
  - bent knee to bar
  - straight leg to bar
  - straight leg to bar requires good hamstring flexibility, hip flexor strength in very short position
  - hold top 2-3 seconds or add ankle weight to bridge progressions
  - stretch hamstrings if they limit
  - control through range
  - don't swing
  - posterior pelvic tilt
  - bring bottom of ribs to top of pelvis
  - for toes to bars, avoid closing shoulders to help bring feet to bar
  - stall bars, bar against bars, prevents shoulder activation
  - 8-15 reps, 2-3 sets, twice a week
  - make sure to stretch hamstrings
