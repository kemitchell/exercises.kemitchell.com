url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0ajs_nFhC8
exercises:
- parallel bars dip
notes:
- dip support hold first
- shoulders depressed at top (far from ears)
- shoulders far from ears
- lock out the elbows
- engage your core
- goal of 4-6 sets, 10 seconds each
- dipping lean forward to engage the chest
- elbow perpendicular to the bar, not leaning forward or back
- lock the elbows out with control, not jerking
- do not flare elbows out
- do not tuck elbows too far in
- elbows above wrists and bars at bottom
- depth depends on shoulder mobility and flexibility
- try with feet on the ground to test your range
- just going to 90 degrees gets all the benefit
- film yourself
- negatives if you can't do one
- bands if you can't get enough reps
- retract shoulder blades (grab imaginary pencil between) at the bottom
- opens up the chest
