title: Perfect Push-Ups
notes: |
  - can scale to any difficulty
  - also train the core
  - shoulder blades protract and retract through range
  - elbows out focus on pecs
  - elows out focus on anterior deltoids
  - excessive flaring can cause discomfort
  - strongest usually 30 to 60 degrees
  - hand placements depends on shoulder movement plane
  - forearms roughly vertical at bottom
  - usually slightly wider than shoulder width
  - don't cut range of motion, bend hips, or arch back
  - squat rack with barbell works well for elevated push-ups
  - harder
  - parallettes for more range of motion
  - add weight
  - elevate the feet
  - archer push-ups
  - don't overcomplicate
  - touch chest to floor
  - straighten arms at top
  - keep body in straight line
  - If elbow flare were a problem, diamond push-ups wouldn't be popular.
