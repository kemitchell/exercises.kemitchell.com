url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RlRDWO2jfg
exercises:
- overhead press
notes: |
  - shoulder flexion
  - elbow extension
  - scapular upward rotation
  - allows good overload
  - usually takes longer to gain strength than other exercises
  - large range of motion
  - con, quite front-delt dominant
  - combine with lateral raises for rear delts
  - moderate to heavy weight
  - 5--10 reps
    bar same height as squat, near armpit
  - slightly wider than shoulder grip
  - get under bar to lift
  - shoulder-width stance
  - slight foot flare
  - elbows slightly outside shoulders
  - rest above wrist, not behind it
  - elbows slightly out from shoulders
  - flex glutes to neutralize spine
  - deep breath, brace
  - press straight up
  - tilt head back to avoid hitting chin
  - push face forward back to neutral
  - knees, hips, shoulders still
  - don't shrug to initiate
  - press up until lockout
  - keep weight centered on midfoot
  - start drop by dropping elbows down and to side
  - complete stop at bottom
  - breathe at bottom
  - alternative in dumbbell press
  - seated can go heavier
  - standing requires more core and side delt
  - dumbbells more out to the sides
  - for dumbbells, 8-15 reps
  - incomplete range of motion most common error
  - don't do touch-and-go reps to avoid bouncing and incomplete range
  - common error not flexing glutes, press forward rather than straight up
  - pushing out risks lower back
