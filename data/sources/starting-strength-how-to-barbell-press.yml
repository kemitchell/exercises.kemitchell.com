notes: |
  - grip width so forearms vertical at bottom/rest position
  - hold along pad of hand, not straight across
  - wrists neutral (slightly extended) so bar stable above hands
  - tips of elbows in front of wrists, so bar doesn't fall forward
  - stance at least squat width
  - knees locked
  - squeeze quads hard
  - squeeze abs hard
  - look straight ahead
  - shrug at top (bicpes to ears)
  - lock elbows out at top
  - keep bar above middles of feet
  - push hips forward to clear face
  - fast hip thrust creates bounce in the bar to lift more
  - time to catch the dip in the bar
