title: Perfect Pull-Ups
notes:
- shoulder width or slightly wider
- each rep as high as possible, aiming to pull chest to bar
- as long as chin clears, rep okay
- fully straighten elbows at bottom
- can depress shoulder blades at bottom to start
- don't have do it intentionally or separately
- he doesn't think about it
- can lower to active or passive hang
- he prefers to lower as far as possible
- as long you fully straighten elbows, rep okay
- hollow body or arched, neither better
- hollow body engages abs, more transferable to muscle-up, harder to initiate, harder at bottom
  arched shortens lever, helps with scapula retraction, easier to touch at top, harder to pause at top
- natural to change throughout rep, hollow at top, arched at bottom
- don't swing or kip
- can bend knees and cross feet if bar too short
- doesn't make a big mechanical difference
- scan wrap thumbs or not use thumbs
- narrow use more shoulder extension
- wider use more shoulder adduction
- easier with bands, negatives
- harder with l-sit, pause at top, add weight
- easiest at bottom, hardest at top
- l-sit challenges in longer positions
- don't overcomplicate
- often best to keep things simple
