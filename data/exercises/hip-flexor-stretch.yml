name: hip flexor stretch
type: static
muscles:
- hip flexors
- psoas
- iliacus
- rectus femoris
- sartorius
cues:
- Do not arch the lumbar spine too much.  Contract the glute on the stretched side.
- Point toes into the ground to aid glute contraction on stretched side.
- Keep the upper back and head up, otherwise connective tissue reduces stretch of the hip flexors.
